# Workshop/Hackathon GANS

The consolidation/reading week offers us an exhilarating opportutnity to learn about the captivating world of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We will run a short workshop (working examples of GANs) followed by an exciting hackathon, all in one day, dedicated to exploring the boundless potential and unleashing the creative prowess of GANs. 

GANs have revolutionized the realm of artificial intelligence, enabling machines to generate astonishingly realistic content such as images, music, and text, among others. 

Hopefully you'll learn about the magic behind GANs, while equiping you with the knowledge and tools you need, and then challenge you to put your newfound skills to the test in a hackathon where your imagination knows no bounds. This event promises to be an exhilarating fusion of education, collaboration, and creativity, making it a must-attend for anyone eager to push the boundaries of what is possible with this cutting-edge technology. 


* Talk/Workshop [Introduction to GANs - Kenwright]
* Working Examples - Try out and test [see how simple and easy it's to get started with GANs]
* Hackathon - Rest of the day developing a GAN of your own for creating some unique content
