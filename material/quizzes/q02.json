  "question": "Which technique is used to discover patterns and relationships in large datasets?",
  "options": {
    "a": "Regression",
    "b": "Clustering",
    "c": "Classification",
    "d": "Association rule mining"
  },
  "answer": "d",
  "clue": "This technique aims to find associations between different items.",
  "explanation": "Association rule mining is a technique used in data mining to discover relationships, dependencies, and associations among items in a dataset. It is often used in market basket analysis and recommendation systems."

  "question": "Which algorithm is a popular approach for supervised learning?",
  "options": {
    "a": "Apriori",
    "b": "K-means",
    "c": "Decision tree",
    "d": "DBSCAN"
  },
  "answer": "c",
  "clue": "This algorithm constructs a flowchart-like structure to make decisions.",
  "explanation": "A decision tree is a popular algorithm for supervised learning. It uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences to create a predictive model. Decision trees are used in various applications, including classification and regression tasks."

{
  "question": "Which evaluation metric is commonly used to assess classification models?",
  "options": {
    "a": "RMSE",
    "b": "R-squared",
    "c": "Accuracy",
    "d": "Mean Absolute Error (MAE)"
  },
  "answer": "c",
  "clue": "It measures the percentage of correct predictions.",
  "explanation": "Accuracy is a widely used evaluation metric for classification models. It measures the percentage of correct predictions made by the model on a given dataset. Accuracy is particularly useful when the classes in the dataset are balanced."

  "question": "Which technique is used for reducing the dimensionality of a dataset?",
  "options": {
    "a": "Linear regression",
    "b": "Principal Component Analysis (PCA)",
    "c": "Naive Bayes",
    "d": "Support Vector Machine (SVM)"
  },
  "answer": "b",
  "clue": "It transforms the original features into a new set of orthogonal features.",
  "explanation": "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a technique used for dimensionality reduction. It identifies the directions (principal components) in which the data varies the most and transforms the data into a new coordinate system that is uncorrelated and ordered by importance."

  "question": "Which algorithm is commonly used for handling missing values in a dataset?",
  "options": {
    "a": "Random Forest",
    "b": "K-nearest neighbors (KNN)",
    "c": "Neural networks",
    "d": "Logistic regression"
  },
  "answer": "b",
  "clue": "It imputes missing values based on similar instances.",
  "explanation": "K-nearest neighbors (KNN) is a popular algorithm used for handling missing values. It imputes missing values by finding the K most similar instances (neighbors) to the instance with missing values and uses their values to impute the missing values."
